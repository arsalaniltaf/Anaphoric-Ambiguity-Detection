# Anaphoric-Ambiguity-Detection

Detection of Anaphoric ambiguity in natural language software requirements

Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is the DAMIR-PURE dataset, originally released as part of the study by Ezzini et al. (2022). The dataset contains manually annotated software requirements focusing on anaphoric ambiguity, and it is widely used in research on Natural Language Requirements Engineering.
I obtained the dataset from the authors’ public release accompanying their ICSE 2022 paper:
